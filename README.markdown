Adds ability to switch between pixels and ems.

A handy bookmarklet that displays the dynamic viewport/screen size in pixels on any website - useful for inspecting and debugging CSS3 `@media` queries and responsive/adaptive layouts.

NB: to use this as a bookmarklet, make sure to stick `javascript:` in front of the minified code, then use that as the href/address of the bookmark.
